Operating System 

   - system Program to manage the system hardware
   - provide the services 

Function of Operating system 
     
       Process Management 
            control the process. 
            wait, stop, kill,.... 

       Memory Management
            Manage memory 
            read, write ,.... 
            
       File Management 
           Files 
           rename, move, copy and so on 

       Device Management 
           monitor keyboard 
           interrupts and signals 
     
       Protection and security 
           chmod, chown, sticky bits 

Components of Operating system 
       user interface 
       boot loader 
       kernel           
       libraries        - c, python libraries 
       system utilites  - package mangager, disk formatters


System calls

Provide interface to the services made available by an operating system. In simple words, 
provide access to the services offered by an operating system

System calls are made by the program, when it needs to access system resources from the kernel of operating system.


Program can execute in two modes 
       - User mode (safe mode)
             No direct connection to the hardware or memory 
             if program crash the application will crash 
             if need memory access then it uses system call to access system resources 

             Context switching 
             converts from user mode to kernel mode 

       - Kernel mode (Privileged mode)
             direct connection to the resources 
             if program crash the entire system will crash

         |
         | System calls ==> write, read , open, close , fork exit , connect, send, mkdir

       OS Kernel  
       Hardware Drivers 
       Hardware 

Example: How to copy the file contents from one file to another 
         write the contents to the file 
         read the content from the file  and so on. 

Types of system calls

        Process management 
          control the process  
          Ex: end , abort, load, execute , create, terminate, get process attributes
              set attributes, wait for time, wait event , signal event , allocate and free    memory. 
        
        File manipulation
        create file, open file, close file, delete file, read, write, get file and set file attributes. 
 
        device management
        request device, release device, get and set device attributes , logically attach and detach devices  

        Information maintenance 
        process id , parent id , stat details and so on 
        
        Communication 
        socket, and so on 

To get the man page 
      man 2 open 
      man 2 write 
      man 2 read
