The main idea of this lab exercise to give hands on experiance on 
grep 
constructs 
command line arguments 

1. write a shell script to get value the pattern and file name from the user and check the pattern exists or not. If the pattern exists print the relavent 
message , if pattern not found print relevent message.

2. Modify the above script to pass the arguments from command line arguments.

3. Modify the above script to pass the values inside the script.

4. validate the script (script 1, script 2)
            - the file exists or not 
            - arguments passed or not 
            
5. Apply grep commands 
   Note: Make sure to use the options -e -c -n -q -s -f -A -B -C -i -h, -l -o -w 
         Frame the questions (as per your choice) 
             to extract user information 
             to extract network information 
             to extract login details
