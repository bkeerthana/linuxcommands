The Quest for the Hidden Flag
==================================
In a world full of puzzles and codes,
One must find the hidden treasure,
For it is buried within the text,
A secret waiting to be discovered.

Seek and you shall find,
The word that stands for victory.
But beware, not every word you see,
Is the true one, only one will suffice.

A clue is hidden somewhere,
But the sign you seek is more unique.
Only the true Flag{Only_The_Seeker_Finds_The_Treasure}can win the game.

Keep searching, the journey's not over,
Until the end is found.
