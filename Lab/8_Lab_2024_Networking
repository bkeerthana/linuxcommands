1.	Use the ping command to test the connectivity to a remote server (e.g., example.com).
2.	Write a script to measure the round-trip time for each packet and analyze the results.
3.	Use the traceroute to trace the route packets take to a destination
4.	Analyze the output to identify any potential bottlenecks or points of failure in the route.
5.	Use the nslookup command to find the IP address of a given domain (e.g., example.com).
6.	Use the netstat command to view active connections and listening ports on your machine.
7.	Use the ifconfig (Linux) or ip a command to display network interface configurations.
8.	Write a script to report document the configuration of each interface, noting the IP address, subnet mask, and any other relevant information.
9.	Perform a basic network scan using nmap on your local network to identify active devices and open ports.
10.	Create a report summarizing the devices found, their IP addresses, and the services running on the open ports.
11.	Capture network packets using tcpdump on a specific interface.
12.	Analyze the captured packets for specific protocols (like HTTP or DNS) and summarize your findings.
13.	Use the whois command to gather registration information about a domain.
14.	Use the hostname command to display and change the hostname of your machine.
15.	Use the finger command to gather information about users on a system.
